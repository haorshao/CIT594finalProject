We have three packages, database is for loading and storing images. Image processing is for two algorithms. And mvc is for the design pattern.

How to use:

1. Run the main function in controller class

2. Load file, if you would like to load image from local storage, just click the load button, and choose the image file. We just set the path as current workspace. Or if you would like to load image from online resources, first enter the link and then click the load button. Any change made to the text field will be regarded as loading online.
